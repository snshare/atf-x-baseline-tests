### Goal of this application
This is a [scoped app](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-application-development/page/build/applications/concept/c_ApplicationScope.html) in ServiceNow to give administrators and developers a faster Automated Testing implementation for a given feature set.

The goal of this application is to have a generic set of baseline tests, for a given product. These tests are generic and should work in any instance after the set of plugins are installed.

### Other useful apps

[ATF Baseline Tests](https://github.com/snshare/atf-baseline-tests) - A set of out of the box tests from Servicenow that don't rely on demo data. This is great when you just install an application and want to make sure all of the functionality works in your instance.
